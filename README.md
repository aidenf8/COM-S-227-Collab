# COM-S-227-Collab
  Just a place where the students of COM S 227 can collectively work on coding projects (non assignment related)

Created projects are (preferably) to be coded in Java.

# TODO
Create a tutorial branch with instructions on how to get started with GitHub, useful imports, and some basic GUI integration.
Create a branch for project requests, in which members of the repo will work collaboratively on the solutions.

# Guidelines
I would prefer that our projects not violate any laws.
Don't post assignments or assignment related questions.
Try to moderate your own levels of copying and pasting. (If I can google "your" code and come up with an exact match, I will probably delete it)
